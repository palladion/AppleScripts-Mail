**2 Applescripts for connecting Apple Mail to other apps**

Best used with text expander software which support Applescript like Keyboard Maestro or Textexpander.

Just copy and paste these 2 scripts as executable Applescript in your text expander app and give it a trigger keyword. 

I use "elink" (short for email link) as keyowrd for the raw URL and "eelink" (short for extended email link) for the Markdown link including Sender and Subject.
