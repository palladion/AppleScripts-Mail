**2 Applescripts for connecting Apple Mail to other apps**

Best used with text expander software which support Applescript like Keyboard Maestro or Textexpander.

Just copy and paste these 2 scripts as executable Applescript in your text expander app and give it a trigger keyword. 

I use "elink" (short for email link) as keyowrd for the raw URL and "eelink" (short for extended email link) for the Markdown link including Sender and Subject. 

Here are the screenshots of my Keyboard Maestro Setup:
